# Assignments for *Intro to Computer Programming I* at the University of Washington

This repository contains assignments that I helped develop for CSE 121, Introduction to
Computer Programming I at the University of Washington. They are from Winter, 2023, when
I served as the Head Teaching Assistant for this course. They were exported from EdStem,
so the links in PDFs do not work properly.

**This repository does not contain any solutions.**
